# Be star binaries with compact objects

**Advisor: Oleg Kargaltsev**

Be stars are rapidly rotating B-class stars with strong stellar winds that produce distinct optical emission lines. It is theorized that they are often found in binary pairs with compact objects (SMBH or NS). This project seeks to identify Be stars with compact object binary partners by analyzing spectra, orbital parameters, flux modulation, astrometric data, and possibly other signatures.
